The pair potential for this was taken from an MSIBI run using a cutoff of 4.0, and a much smaller gsd-write out period

I used the potential from the last iteraiton

This cg potential dir contains updated angle potentials
derived from a second round of MSIBI on angles
where the entire CG forcefield was used during MSIBI
