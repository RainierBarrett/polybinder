This forcefield uses the CG table potentials learned from MSIBI.

Notes:
- The E-E and E-K bond stretching potentials were obtained from single chain, T/I = 1.0 simulations
- The pair potentials were obtained using 4 states, all evenly weighted with an alpha of 1.0
- the pair potentials were optimized using 1e6 steps per iteration
